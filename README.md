##Dataset used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcelbiezunski/laliga-matches-dataset-2019-2025-fbref

## Project Overview

This comprehensive football analytics report examines the performance patterns of Spanish LaLiga teams across six seasons (2020-2025), providing detailed insights into team effectiveness, goal-scoring trends, and competitive dynamics within Spain's premier football league.

## Key Research Questions Addressed

### 1. **Team Performance Consistency**
- Which teams maintain the highest win rates across multiple seasons?
- How do elite teams (Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid) compare in terms of consistent performance?
- What are the performance fluctuations of mid-tier and lower-tier teams?

### 2. **Goal-Scoring Evolution**
- How has the average goals per match evolved across the six-season period?
- Which teams demonstrate the most effective attacking strategies?
- What is the relationship between expected goals (xG) and actual goal performance?

### 3. **Match Outcome Distribution**
- What is the overall distribution of wins, draws, and losses across all teams?
- How do seasonal variations affect match outcomes?
- Which teams show improvement or decline in recent seasons?

## Analytical Processes and Methodology

### **Data Collection and Preparation**
- Comprehensive dataset covering 27 LaLiga teams across 6 seasons
- Match-level data including goals scored, match outcomes, and expected goals (xG)
- Seasonal aggregation and team-level performance metrics

### **Performance Metrics Calculation**
- **Win Rate Analysis**: Percentage of matches won per team per season
- **Goal Efficiency**: Average goals scored per match by season
- **Expected Goals Comparison**: Actual vs predicted goal performance
- **Outcome Distribution**: Classification of all matches into wins, draws, and losses

### **Visualization and Dashboard Creation**
- Interactive Power BI dashboard with multiple analytical views
- Team filtering capabilities for focused analysis
- Seasonal trend visualization with temporal comparisons
- Performance ranking systems for competitive benchmarking

## Key Project Insights

### **Elite Team Dominance**
- **Real Madrid** emerges as the most consistent performer with a 68% overall win rate
- **Barcelona** maintains strong performance (66% win rate) despite some seasonal fluctuations
- **Atletico Madrid** shows significant improvement trajectory, reaching 59% overall win rate

### **Competitive Landscape Evolution**
- **Girona** demonstrates remarkable emergence as a competitive force in recent seasons
- Traditional mid-tier teams like **Sevilla** show declining performance trends
- **Real Sociedad** maintains consistent mid-table performance around 45% win rate

### **Goal-Scoring Trends**
- Slight upward trend in average goals per match from 2020 to 2025
- Peak goal-scoring periods observed in 2023-2024 seasons
- Strong correlation between expected goals (xG) and actual performance for top teams

### **Match Outcome Patterns**
- Overall league distribution: 36% wins, 36% draws, 27% losses per team
- Increasing competitiveness evidenced by fluctuating draw rates
- Seasonal variations suggest evolving tactical approaches across the league

## Final Conclusions

### **Performance Hierarchy Stability**
The analysis reveals a relatively stable competitive hierarchy in LaLiga, with Real Madrid and Barcelona maintaining their positions as dominant forces. However, the emergence of teams like Girona and the decline of traditionally strong teams like Sevilla indicate that the league's competitive balance is evolving.

### **Tactical Evolution**
The gradual increase in average goals per match suggests an evolution toward more offensive-minded football across the league, possibly reflecting tactical innovations and rule changes that favor attacking play.

### **Predictive Accuracy**
The strong alignment between expected goals (xG) and actual performance for top teams validates the effectiveness of modern football analytics in predicting team success, while also highlighting which teams overperform or underperform relative to their underlying metrics.

### **Strategic Implications**
For football analysts, coaches, and management:
- **Performance sustainability** requires consistent tactical adaptation
- **Expected goals metrics** serve as reliable indicators of long-term team quality
- **Seasonal variations** emphasize the importance of squad depth and tactical flexibility
- **Emerging teams** like Girona demonstrate that strategic planning can rapidly elevate competitive position

This analysis provides a foundational understanding of LaLiga's competitive dynamics and serves as a valuable resource for strategic decision-making in football management, player recruitment, and tactical development.
